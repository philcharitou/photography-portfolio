To say that photographing this couple has been so much fun would be un understatement.
From the day we met, I knew weâ€™d get along famously. They are so much fun. And genuinely such great people.
I photographed their engagement gathering at their lovely home some months prior, and their wedding was held at the beautiful Angus Glen Golf Club in Markham.
A lovely December wedding that warmed my heart right up.
Here are some highlights from their special day.
