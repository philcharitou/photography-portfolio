I worked with Drape & stitch to capture the unique and elegant appeal of their custom uniform designs. More specifically their Spring - Summer collection 2024. In doing so I had the opportunity to work with some wonderfully talented models and designers. Most photographs were taken with a 3-light set-up but some utilized harder shadows to emphasize form.
