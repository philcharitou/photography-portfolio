What can I say about Seth and Ruchie.They are one of the absolute sweetest, kindest couples I have ever photographed. To start off their engagement session they wanted to take a series of photos with their closest family and friends. We chatted briefly throughout the set-up process and I occasionally snapped some photos when the light and moment were right. Then, before the sun went down we took the glamour shots with the ring. We hadnâ€™t expected it to be so bright and sunny that evening, and right after we ended the session there was an overcast and some rain. But as we were shooting Mother Nature put on a light and shine-show for us. One moment the sky was clear and the next it was filled with rolling clouds and beautiful colours. Ruchie and Seth naturally blended with the crowd of their loved ones and amongst themselves. Below are a series of photos from that way
