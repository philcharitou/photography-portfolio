title: 'Phil Charitou Photography About Me | Toronto Photographer Information'
about: |-
  I'm a photographer and software developer based in Toronto, Canada, who in recent years has pursued far-reaching artistic goals in capturing moments within the wildlife and portrait genre.
  <br><br>I started my career working with digital art production alongside web design and have several years of personal project experience with creative retouching, layout and graphic design, before I began venturing into composition and photography.
  <br><br>In combination with a great passion for the outdoors, I thrive working in a challenging environment. Exploring the technicality and expression of photography has been a joy and wonderful marriage of creativity and practiced expertise. I believe telling stories through photography and capturing important moments are tantamount to reliving and preserving both seemingly innocuous and pivotal moments in our lives
