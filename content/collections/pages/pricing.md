      **What defines an "Event"?** It's hard to say! <br><br>


      Birthdays, Corporate/Company Outings, Live Music, Parties, etc. all fall under this category. As such, the rates will vary on a case-by-case basis but I have some rough outlines listed below. Depending on the scope and expectations for your particular situation these fees may be lower or higher.<br><br>

  Lets talk pricing.

  Below are several standard rates for services I offer. If these don't meet your needs or you were expecting something different I would be happy to talk to you and figure out a solution. These prices exist in an effort to be _honest and transparent_! Please take a look and if you still have questions you can reach me through my [Contact Page](https://philcharitou.com/contact).

  Photographs can be complex, and elicit complex feelings! I understand that to you, these photos can represent anything from a personal branding measure to capturing timeless moments for your friend and family. As such, there is no "one price fits all". I offer standard rates to be transparent and so none of your valuable time is wasted shopping around for quotes. That being said, sometimes these rates can't capture every type of shoot.
