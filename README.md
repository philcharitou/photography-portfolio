## About This Website

This is my personal portfolio. Built using the Statamic CMS package built on-top of Laravel with a custom backend.

While this application is not plug and plan, it may serve as a useful base for those wishing to quickly spin up a simple front-end with document-based authentication and some pre-built YAML files, tailored for photography. It is simple enough to strip this website down and customize it to your needs however.

## Some Notes

This application uses some custom logic within the 'report' method of the global exception handler class.

Some packages I personally like to implement when starting a project like this:

    Laravel Auditing
        composer require owen-it/laravel-auditing
    Laravel Permissions (by Spatie)
        composer require spatie/laravel-permission
